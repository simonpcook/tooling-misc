Miscellaneous Toolchain Scripts
===============================

This repository contains useful scripts/tools to speed up toolchain building
and testing. It is intended to be generic, and where possible scripts that are
specific to one architecture should not appear (or if they must, in a
subdirectory specific to that target).

Unless otherwise described, all tools are available under the GPL, see
individual tools/license files for more details.
